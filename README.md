# Natural Language Processing with Spark NLP

This the repo for the book [Natural Language Processing with Spark NLP: Learning to Understand Text at Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Spark-NLP/dp/1492047767)

I have two folders for the notebooks

- `colab` is the folder containing the notebooks to be run on google colab
- `jupyter` is the folder to run the notebooks locally

I'm am working on a docker deployment, and it should be done soon.

There are a couple chapters where you may run into problems

- Chapter 9: I've had some problems running the Core NLP server
- Chapter 13: Uploading the data to Neo4j takes a very long time
- Chapter 14: I've had some problems with spark-elasticsearch interface, also I have not been able to run elasticsearch on colab
